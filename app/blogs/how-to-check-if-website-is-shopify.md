# How to Check If a Website Is Built on Shopify in 2025 (5 Free Methods + Real Examples)

If you work in **ecommerce**, **sales**, **lead qualification**, or **agency services**, you often need to verify:

> **Is this store built on Shopify?**

As of 2025, Shopify powers over 2 million stores globally — including top brands like Gymshark, Allbirds, Kylie Cosmetics, and Fashion Nova.

Good news: checking if a website uses Shopify is now extremely fast and accurate.

Below are **5 free methods**, supported with **real examples** and **live URLs** you can test immediately.

---

## ⚡ Method 1: Use ShopifyOrNot.in (Instant Check in <2 Seconds)

The fastest and simplest method:

👉 **https://shopifyornot.in**

### Try these live examples:

- https://shopifyornot.in/gymshark.com → ✔️ Shopify
- https://shopifyornot.in/allbirds.com → ✔️ Shopify
- https://shopifyornot.in/tesla.com → ❌ Not Shopify
- https://shopifyornot.in/fashionnova.com → ✔️ Shopify Plus
- https://shopifyornot.in/heatonist.com → ✔️ Shopify
- https://shopifyornot.in/amazon.com → ❌ Not Shopify

**Why this is the best method:**

- No extension
- No login
- Fastest detection
- Accurate for Shopify + Shopify Plus + headless setups

For daily checks, use this method first.

## 🔍 Method 2: The “myshopify.com” Redirect Trick (Works 98% of the Time)

Every Shopify store has a secret base domain:

`brandname.myshopify.com`

Open this in your browser.

The result reveals everything.

### Example tests (you can try now):

| Test URL | Result |
|----------|--------|
| gymshark.myshopify.com | Shopify login → ✔️ |
| allbirds.myshopify.com | Login page → ✔️ |
| fashionnova.myshopify.com | Active → ✔️ Shopify Plus |
| colourpop.myshopify.com | Login → ✔️ Shopify Plus |
| tesla.myshopify.com | 404 → ❌ Not Shopify |
| apple.myshopify.com | 404 → ❌ Not Shopify |

**How to read results:**

- **Redirect or login page** → Definitely Shopify
- **404** → Not Shopify (*or extremely rare Plus firewall block*)

Still reliable in 2025.

## 🧑‍💻 Method 3: View Page Source (Search for Shopify Code)

Right-click → **View Page Source**  
Press **Ctrl+F** to search these terms:

- `Shopify.theme`
- `Shopify.design_mode`
- `cdn.shopify.com`
- `checkout.shopify.com`
- `myshopify.com`

### Real-world examples:

#### Gymshark.com  
Search: `Shopify.theme`  
Found:  
`Shopify.theme = {"name":"Gymshark - Turbo v11"...}`  
→ Shopify confirmed.

#### KylieCosmetics.com  
Search: `checkout.shopify.com`  
Found dozens of matches → Shopify Plus.

#### FashionNova.com  
Search: `myshopify.com`  
Hidden but present → Shopify Plus.

#### Tesla.com  
Search: `Shopify`  
0 results → Not Shopify.

This method works even on **headless** stores.

## 🛒 Method 4: Check Cart or Checkout URL (Always Revealing)

Shopify checkout URLs follow a predictable signature.

Test these:

- https://gymshark.com/cart → Shopify
- https://allbirds.com/checkouts → Shopify checkout
- https://heatonist.com/password → Shopify password page
- https://fashionnova.com/checkouts/... → Shopify Plus checkout
- https://tesla.com/cart → Custom → Not Shopify

**Note:**  
Shopify Plus stores can heavily customize the frontend, but **checkout cannot be fully hidden**.

---

## 🧰 Method 5: Use Extensions & Paid Tools (Verified on 30 Nov 2025)

Tool comparison:

| Store | ShopifyOrNot.in | Wappalyzer | Koala Inspector | BuiltWith |
|--------|----------------|------------|------------------|-----------|
| Gymshark | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Fashion Nova | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ (41 apps) | ✔️ |
| Tesla | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Reign Body Fuel | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ✔️ |
| Glossier (custom after 2024) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
